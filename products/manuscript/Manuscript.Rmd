The structure below is a possible setup for a data analysis project (including the course project). For a manuscript, adjust as needed.


# Summary/Abstract

# Introduction 

## General Background Information

## Description of data and data source
Data from the Texas Health Department, as of 10/3/2021.
-New confirmed cases and fatalities by date (n = 579)
-Confirmed cases and fatalities aggregated by county (n = 254)

Download lineage/clade metadata from GISAID for each county

## Questions/Hypotheses to be addressed
Look at spatial heterogeneity within Texas counties (case incidence and mortality)

Estimate the reproductive number for each county

Assess the association between population size, population density, and dominant lineage/clade with case incidence, mortality, and reproductive number (regression model)

Use DSAIDE package, regression methods

# Methods and Results

## Data aquisition
_As applicable, explain where and how you got the data. If you directly import the data from an online source, you can combine this section with the next._

## Data import and cleaning
_Write code that reads in the file and cleans it so it's ready for analysis. Since this will be fairly long code for most datasets, it might be a good idea to have it in one or several R scripts. If that is the case, explain here briefly what kind of cleaning/processing you do, and provide more details and well documented code somewhere (e.g. as supplement in a paper). All materials, including files that contain code, should be commented well so everyone can follow along._

## Exploratory analysis

_Use a combination of text/tables/figures to explore and describe your data. You should produce plots or tables or other summary quantities for the most interesting/important quantities in your data. Depending on the total number of variables in your dataset, explore all or some of the others. FIgures produced here might be histograms or density plots, correlation plots, etc. Tables might summarize your data._

_Continue by creating plots or tables of the outcome(s) of interest and the predictor/exposure/input variables you are most interested in. If your dataset is small, you can do that for all variables. Plots produced here can be scatterplots, boxplots, violinplots, etc. Tables can be simple 2x2 tables or larger ones._

_To get some further insight into your data, if reasonable you could compute simple statistics (e.g. t-tests, simple regression model with 1 predictor, etc.) to look for associations between your outcome(s) and each individual predictor variable. Though note that unless you pre-specified the outcome and main exposure, any "p<0.05 means statistical significance" interpretation is not valid._

Table \@ref(tab:summarytable) shows a table summarizing the data.


```{r summarytable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/summarytable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Data summary table.')
```


Figure \@ref(fig:epicurve) shows an epi curve produced by one of the R scripts.

```{r epicurve,  fig.cap='Epi Curve.', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../../results/epicurve.png")
```


## Full analysis

_Use one or several suitable statistical/machine learning methods to analyze your data and to produce meaningful figures, tables, etc. This might again be code that is best placed in one or several separate R scripts that need to be well documented. You want the code to produce figures and data ready for display as tables, and save those. Then you load them here._

Example table \@ref(tab:resulttable) shows a table summarizing a linear model fit.

```{r resulttable,  echo=FALSE}
resulttable=readRDS("../../results/resulttable.rds")
knitr::kable(resulttable, caption = 'Linear model fit table.')
```


# Discussion

## Summary and Interpretation
_Summarize what you did, what you found and what it means._

## Strengths and Limitations
_Discuss what you perceive as strengths and limitations of your analysis._

## Conclusions
_What are the main take-home messages?_

_Include citations in your Rmd file using bibtex, the list of references will automatically be placed at the end_

This paper [@Leek2015a] discusses types of analyses. 

Note that this cited reference will show up at the end of the document, the reference formatting is determined by the CSL file specified in the YAML header. Many more style files for almost any journal [are available](https://www.zotero.org/styles). You also specify the location of your bibtex reference file in the YAML. You can call your reference file anything you like, I just used the generic word `references.bib` but giving it a more descriptive name is probably better.
